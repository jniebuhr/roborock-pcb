# Roborock CPAP PCB

[![](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/APw7rgPGPf)](https://discord.gg/APw7rgPGPf)

This repository contains a custom PCB for use with the awesome work at [Roborock CPAP](https://github.com/condottab/Roborock-CPAP). The PCB shields the controller board from any back flow that might occur from the brushless controller.

The logic is the same as in the work of [stas2z](https://github.com/stas2z) but reshaped to better fit on the back of the blower while also allowing
for a cooling fan to be added.

## Pinout

![](assets/pinout.png)

**Attention:**  
This pinout changed in version 0.2.0 due to a rotation of a connector. The same cables will work though since the connector has only been rotated. Refer to the writing on the back of your board.

## Ordering

The files to order this PCB are in the `kicad/jlcpcb` sub-folder. These work with the JLCPCB assembly service as well, there will be extended component fees though.

## Mounting options

I have also developed some additional mounting options for the Roborock Fan:

* [VzBot 235](mounting/vzbot-235)
* more coming soon...
